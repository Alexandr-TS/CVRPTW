1) For MinMax - binary search over the time when all the drons will return back to the depot

2) For MinSum:
    
A)
Sort the targets by start_time ascending
for each target find the best dron:
    it has enough time
    among all such drons - find the nearest one

B)
Take 1 dron. Fly to the nearest one (max from start_time and the time when the can reach the target)
